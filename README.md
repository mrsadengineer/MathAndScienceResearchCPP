# MathAndScienceResearchCPP
This repository is for practice and learning C++. I hope to create an interactive console app 

 
 
 Todo:  
-[X] Set up unit testing project in c++   
-[X] create first test  
-[X] simple start console interaction  
-[ ] implement OOP classes in Cpp  
-[ ] create c implementation and use library.   
-[ ] Learn about implementating Modules     

## Progression
Pure Mathematics  
 * linear Algebra  
 * abstract algebra  
 * calculus
 * Real Analysis
 * Topology
 * Differential Equations  
 * Complex Analysis  
 * Differential Geometry  


## Introduction - the project's aim  
Console app for explore and testing out math concepts in C++.   

## Technologies
Project is created with:  

C++

## Project status
The project is 'in progree' 
Setting up working enviroment. (in progress)  
 *visual studio 2019

## Scope of functionalities
basic functions  
* basic procedural implementation in cpp
* basic OOP implementation with cpp
* using c library for cpp console  

OOP functions
* use classes

system function  

* deploy with Docker ()  
* documented with github    
* build through github actions  
* create unit test program. (how does this work with github)
