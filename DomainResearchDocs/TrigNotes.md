Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with triangles. Trigonometry is also known as the study of relationships between lengths and angles of triangles.

There is an enormous number of uses of trigonometry and its formulae. For example, the technique of triangulation is used in Geography to measure the distance between landmarks; in Astronomy, to measure the distance to nearby stars and also in satellite navigation systems.


If θ is one of the acute angles in a triangle, then the sine of theta is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse, the cosine is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse, and the tangent is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.


Basic Formulas
There are basically 6 ratios used for finding the elements in Trigonometry. They are called trigonometric functions. The six trigonometric functions are sine, cosine, secant, co-secant, tangent and co-tangent.

By using a right-angled triangle as a reference, the trigonometric functions or identities are derived:

sin θ = Opposite Side/Hypotenuse
cos θ = Adjacent Side/Hypotenuse
tan θ = Opposite Side/Adjacent Side
sec θ = Hypotenuse/Adjacent Side
cosec θ = Hypotenuse/Opposite Side
cot θ = Adjacent Side/Opposite Side

Reciprocal Identities
The Reciprocal Identities are given as:

cosec θ = 1/sin θ
sec θ = 1/cos θ
cot θ = 1/tan θ
sin θ = 1/cosec θ
cos θ = 1/sec θ
tan θ = 1/cot θ
All these are taken from a right angled triangle. With the height and base side of the right triangle given, we can find out the sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent values using trigonometric formulas. The reciprocal trigonometric identities are also derived by using the trigonometric functions.


sine_of_theta = opposite / hyp

(opposite = how much verticel
hyp = how much total foruce 

sine_of_beta => Projection to "y" direction


example:
sine_of_theta = 3/5

3/5 = 0.6

=> 0.6 of Total force is in y-direction
